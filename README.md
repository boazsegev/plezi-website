# Contributing to the Website / Documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the facil.io website and documentation.

NOTICE: `_SOURCE` is the folder that contains the actual documentation files. Edits to the documentation should be placed in this folder.

Anything outside the `_SOURCE` folder (including this file) is created automatically by the `server` script and shouldn't be edited.

If you want to contribute to the documentation, please do so by opening a Pull Request (PR) with updates to the files in the `_SOURCE` folder.

## Running the website locally

It's possible to run a local version of the website using Ruby (make sure to have Ruby and Ruby gems available on your system).

Open the terminal window and go to the `_SOURCE` folder. Than run (currently runs on macOS and Linux):

    $ bundle install
    $ ./server
